# Native quilt and profiles

## Scope and direction contract

Mode: Operate. Platform: iOS/iPadOS. The user explicitly pinned the existing web quilt's behavior and requested clean native styling without textile decoration. This extends the native prototype; no alternate visual concepts or raster comps are needed.

THESIS: The same rearranging quilt, rendered as legible native blocks. Filtering removes nonmatches and packs the remaining patches together; it never merely dims a fixed overview.
OWN-WORLD: System surfaces, San Francisco, one action tint, restrained block fills, and SF Symbols. No fabric, stitches, textures, hand lettering, or decorative filler.
STORY: Choose a quilt, explore by touch or search/interests, switch between quilt/map/list, open a patch, and find its next events or directions.
FIRST VIEWPORT: One top bar — Filter, the live search field, the account menu — painting nothing over a canvas that runs under the status bar, the bar and the tab bar; the Quilt/Map/List segmented control floats at the foot. The tab bar reads Quilt (the quilt's own icon; hold to switch), Events, Discover, and a Search button that focuses the field. Patch profiles dock as a native sheet at the head's height and pull up to full screen. (Revised 2026-09-20 to align with the mobile web shell; the first cut put the segmented control under the title.)
FORM: User-pinned native adaptation, not a new visual-world selection. No seed or generated comp. Native pan/zoom and animated repacking carry the experience; Reduce Motion suppresses the slide.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance.

## Behavioral reference

Reference server/web commit: cc74376. The web implementation is consulted as behavioral evidence, not bundled in this MPL client.

- Square grid sizes follow activity floors and competition-rank caps. Quiet quilts remain equal-sized.
- Placement uses the API's affinity strengths; positions are not geographic coordinates.
- A selected interest matches any selected tag. A text query matches a patch's name OR description, case- and diacritic-insensitively. Text and interests intersect.
- Filtered subsets are repacked with original placed sizes as the starting sizes, with the layout's fit flexibility. Clearing filters restores the full quilt.
- The list's default order follows the current quilt's placement order. Name and recently-added sorts are also available.
- Native map uses actual patch coordinates and the same narrowed patch set.
- Selecting a patch opens its profile while keeping the quilt's filter and viewport intact behind it.

Account operations, remote blended My Quilt regions, and full web-product parity are outside this browsing pass. No authenticated state is fabricated.

## Verification — 2026-09-20

Nine unit tests and three iPhone simulator UI tests pass. The complete browsing and gesture flow also passes on iPad. Layout fixtures compare 24 synthetic full/filtered examples with the web reference; a local check of Lancaster’s current 59 patches matched positions, sizes, and placement order. No live community data is checked in.

The independent native finish reviewer returned **ship** for the three reviewed corrections: bounded Dynamic Type labels, intentional small-tile truncation, and verified pinch/tap behavior. The gesture regression check ensures a pinch never opens a profile; tapping opens it, and dismissal preserves the quilt position and scale. Simulator review does not substitute for a physical-device or VoiceOver audit.

## Shell alignment — 2026-09-20

The shell was aligned with the mobile web's decisions (web CONTEXT.md "Shell & navigation" and "Docked profile"; ADRs 033, 074, 075, 078, 094) and then reshaped for a native app that owns its chrome:

- One top bar on every discovery surface: Filter (badged) · search pill · account menu. Notifications and the user's own entries belong in the account menu once sign-in exists; the web's bottom-shelf search moved up here.
- The tab bar is Quilt · Events · Discover. The Quilt item wears the quilt's icon, and a hold on it opens the switcher. Dashboard is deliberately absent until there is an account to dash.
- Search never narrows by typing (ADR 033). The field activates in place and lists patches and upcoming events under it; one row sets the search chip. The tab bar's Search button focuses the same field.
- Filter chips are ranked by how many patches wear them and live in a sheet the quilt repacks behind.
- A tap hands back the patch's own profile, docked (ADR 094): head at rest, full screen on the pull, events fetched by the pull.
- Discover is ADR 075 without the follow: the question, the eight most-worn tags with counts, the patches wearing them with the soonest event first.
- `QuiltSession` holds one quilt's patches and filter state so the quilt, Discover, and search read the same thing.
