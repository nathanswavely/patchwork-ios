# Native quilt and profiles

## Scope and direction contract

Mode: Operate. Platform: iOS/iPadOS. The user explicitly pinned the existing web quilt's behavior and requested clean native styling without textile decoration. This extends the native prototype; no alternate visual concepts or raster comps are needed.

THESIS: The same rearranging quilt, rendered as legible native blocks. Filtering removes nonmatches and packs the remaining patches together; it never merely dims a fixed overview.
OWN-WORLD: System surfaces, San Francisco, one action tint, restrained block fills, and SF Symbols. No fabric, stitches, textures, hand lettering, or decorative filler.
STORY: Choose a quilt, explore by touch or search/interests, switch between quilt/map/list, open a patch, and find its next events or directions.
FIRST VIEWPORT: Native navigation and quilt identity above a Quilt/Map/List segmented control; the interactive canvas owns the remaining screen. Native filter and fit/zoom controls stay within safe areas. Patch profiles open in a dismissible native sheet with a navigation stack for events.
FORM: User-pinned native adaptation, not a new visual-world selection. No seed or generated comp. Native pan/zoom and animated repacking carry the experience; Reduce Motion suppresses the slide.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance.

## Behavioral reference

Reference server/web commit: cc74376. The web implementation is consulted as behavioral evidence, not bundled in this MPL client.

- Square grid sizes follow activity floors and competition-rank caps. Quiet quilts remain equal-sized.
- Placement uses the API's affinity strengths; positions are not geographic coordinates.
- A selected interest matches any selected tag. A text query matches a patch's name OR description, case- and diacritic-insensitively. Text and interests intersect.
- Filtered subsets are repacked with original placed sizes as the starting sizes, with the layout's fit flexibility. Clearing filters restores the full quilt.
- The list's default order follows the current quilt's placement order. Name and recently-added sorts are also available.
- Native map uses actual patch coordinates and the same narrowed patch set.
- Selecting a patch opens its profile while keeping the quilt's filter and viewport intact behind it.

Account operations, remote blended My Quilt regions, and full web-product parity are outside this browsing pass. No authenticated state is fabricated.

## Verification — 2026-09-20

Nine unit tests and three iPhone simulator UI tests pass. The complete browsing and gesture flow also passes on iPad. Layout fixtures compare 24 synthetic full/filtered examples with the web reference; a local check of Lancaster’s current 59 patches matched positions, sizes, and placement order. No live community data is checked in.

The independent native finish reviewer returned **ship** for the three reviewed corrections: bounded Dynamic Type labels, intentional small-tile truncation, and verified pinch/tap behavior. The gesture regression check ensures a pinch never opens a profile; tapping opens it, and dismissal preserves the quilt position and scale. Simulator review does not substitute for a physical-device or VoiceOver audit.
